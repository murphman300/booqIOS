        <br><br>When you provide us with personal information to access, use, or refer one or several of our Services, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.

        <br><br>If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.

    <h2>SECTION 5 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h2>
    <p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.
        <br><br>However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.
        <br><br>For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers. You can find our providers here:
        <br><a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase</a>
        <br><br>In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.
        <br><br>As an example, if you are located in Canada and your information is processed by a server located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that network request may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archive/ll/highlights.htm">Patriot Act</a>.
        <br><br>Once you leave our app or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service</a>.
        <br><br><b>Links</b>
        <br><br>When you click on links on our store, they may direct you away from our site or app. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to read their privacy statements.</p>
    <h2>SECTION 6 - SECURITY</h2>

If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here that it has been updated, so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we use and/or disclose it.
        <br><br>If our project, company, or entity that operates this website now or in the future is acquired or merged with another company, your information may be transferred to the new owners so that we may continue to provide our Services to you.</p>
